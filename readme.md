Adam's dotfiles. Largely based on Simon Owen, but bits and pieces from all over the place.

Some important notes:
* Other people may find this useful, but it's mostly for me to use personally.
* Edit the install.conf.json file to include/exclude the files you actually want to use.
* Run the install bash script to install - it makes symlinks to the "undotted" versions of the files as dotfiles in your user folder.
* Take a look in the aliases file - there are some handy shortcuts in there that are really only useful to me. You'll probably want to remove them or replace with your own.
